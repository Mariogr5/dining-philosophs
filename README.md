### This is a simple multithreaded program simulating the feasting philosophers problem.
The program solves the problem of deadlock and starvation using the Dijkstra method by establishing an appropriate schedule of resource access (forks).
The user enters the number of feasting philosophers in the range of 5 - 10 and observes the visualization of different philosophers' access to the forks and their individual states.
The program runs on a total of (number_of_philosophers + 1(visualization)) threads. The ncurses library was used to visualize the completed task.
